## Getting Started

The Beta version of CornChat is now available.

### HipChat for Mac Installation

```bash
$ (todo: some cmd to inject the bundle)
```
> Restart your HipChat client and you should see it running.

### HipChat Browser Installation

Login to your HipChat app and run this command to inject CornChat onto the page:

```javascript
var cornchat = document.createElement('script');
cornchat.setAttribute('src','https://TODO_PROVIDE_FULL_PATH_TO_THE_BUNDLE/bundle.js');
document.head.appendChild(cornchat);
```

## How it Works

TODO: Teaser about how it works, with link to deeper architecture.


## Licensing

CornChat is [free](https://github.com/rkuzsma/cornchat/) and [open source](https://github.com/rkuzsma/cornchat) forever.

Reactions and tags are stored on our AWS server. No guarantees for uptime or data loss. You can always (TODO: LINK!) host it yourself if the free, public, hosted version isn't sufficient.
