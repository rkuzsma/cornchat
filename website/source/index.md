## How it Works

TODO: Teaser about how it works, with link to deeper architecture.


## Licensing

CornChat is [free](https://github.com/rkuzsma/cornchat/) and [open source](https://github.com/rkuzsma/cornchat) forever.

Reactions and tags are stored on our AWS server. No guarantees for uptime or data loss. You can always (TODO: LINK!) host it yourself if the free, public, hosted version isn't sufficient.


## Cure Cancer

Like CornChat? Hate Cancer? Please help my daughter Quinn and [donate 5 bucks to Alex’s Lemonade Stand](https://www.alexslemonade.org/donate). Don’t think too hard about it, just do it. It takes 2 minutes and the payment form is beautifully designed. You will feel great doing it.
